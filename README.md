# Optimize Tesla charging on Nordpool spot prices, utilizing the TeslaMateAPI

The objective is to optimize Tesla charging based on Nordpool spot electricity prices, incorporating the following features:
   * The charging window starts at trigger time, the end time is configurable in code
   * The automation identifies the most cost-effective contiguous time period within the charging window
   * Charge duration is estimated based on the current battery level and ambient temperature (the battery heater is required below 0Â°C)
   * Charging is controlled using the scheduled charging feature
   * In the event of a failure in determining the charge start time, 23:00 is used as a fallback
   * A charge is scheduled only if, at the time of execution, the car is:
      * Plugged in
      * Scheduled to start charging, and not charging at the moment

This is implemented as a Node-RED flow, built on
   * TeslaMate
   * TeslaMateAPI
   * Node-RED
   * Nordpool prices from https://spot-hinta.fi
   * NPM package ```js-linq```

# Setup

## TeslaMate

Obviously you need a working TeslaMate setup, running on Docker Compose. I run mine on Raspberry P 4.

## TeslaMateAPI

Install TeslaMateAPI based on the instructions on this repository: https://github.com/tobiasehlert/teslamateapi

The docker-compose.yml snippet from my installation
   * ```ENCRYPTION_KEY``` has the same value as ENCRYPTION_KEY of the teslamate container in the same file
   * ```API_TOKEN``` is the secret token used in the Node-RED flow
   * ```TZ```, use your own time zone

```
  teslamateapi:
    image: tobiasehlert/teslamateapi:latest
    restart: always
    depends_on:
      - database
    environment:
      - ENCRYPTION_KEY=***
      - DATABASE_USER=teslamate
      - DATABASE_PASS=secret
      - DATABASE_NAME=teslamate
      - DATABASE_HOST=database
      - MQTT_HOST=mosquitto
      - TZ=Europe/Helsinki
      - API_TOKEN=***
      - ENABLE_COMMANDS=true
      - COMMANDS_CHARGING=true
    ports:
      - 4001:8080
```

## Node-RED

Install Node-RED based on the instructions on this document: https://docs.teslamate.org/docs/integrations/Node-RED

The docker-compose.yml snippet from my installation
   * ```TZ```, use your own time zone

```
  node-red:
    image: nodered/node-red:latest
    restart: always
    environment:
      - TZ=Europe/Helsinki
    volumes:
      - node-red-data:/data
    ports:
      - 1881:1880

volumes:
  node-red-data:
```

The file ```add-nr-modules.sh```, add ```js-linq```

```
#!/bin/sh

MODULES="node-red-contrib-calc
node-red-contrib-simpletime
node-red-dashboard
node-red-node-email
node-red-contrib-telegrambot
node-red-node-ui-table
js-linq"
set -x
for MODULE in $MODULES
do
docker compose exec -T node-red npm install --no-audit --no-update-notifier --no-fund --save --prefix=/data --production $MODULE
done
docker compose stop node-red
docker compose start node-red
```

## The Node-RED flow

Import the file ```nordpool-teslamateapi.json``` into Node-RED. This will create a new flow, with the nodes in the picture
   * Edit the node 'Trigger at 22:55' to set the charge window start. The scheduled time for the trigger should be ~5 minutes before full hour of the earliest charge start time
   * Edit the node 'Schedule charge', and enter the ```API_TOKEN``` value into the 'Token' field
   * Edit the node 'Calculate charge start based on Nordpool prices' to set your preferences
   * Edit the node 'spot-hinta.fi TodayAndDayForward FI' to set your Nordpool market area (in URL parameter), default is 'FI'
      * See https://www.nordpoolgroup.com/en/maps/#/nordic
   * _The file ```nordpool-teslamateapi.js``` is just the source code of the 'Calculate charge start based on Nordpool prices' node_

The purpose of the 'Resume logging' node is to enhance TeslaMate's accuracy in logging charges. The workflow involves scheduling a 'resume logging' action in TeslaMate one minute before the charge begins. This step is crucial as, without it, TeslaMate might miss capturing several minutes at the start of the charging process.

### Test the flow

Plug in your car and schedule a charge to start in the future. I.e. the car should not be charging when the flow is tested.

Click on the blue button on the left side of the trigger node
   * If the car is not plugged in with scheduled charging, the 'Calculate charge start based on Nordpool prices' node will show 'Not plugged in with scheduled charge...' status
   * If the car is ready to be scheduled, the node should show the scheduled charge start time as status
   * Open the Tesla app, or check the charge schedule from the car. The car should be scheduled to charge at the time calculated by the automation

# Changelog

   * 2024-01-29 Initial version
   * 2024-01-30 fix: chargePercentagePointsPerHourColdFactor was not used in charge time calculation
   * 2024-02-09 Switch from nordpoolapi NPM package to spot-hinta.fi REST API, more flexible charge window, fix bug on cold weather charge time calculation
   * 2024-02-11 Removed geolocation, instead the nordpool-optimized timing will work on any location which has scheduled charging. Fixed bug on charge window calculation (was one hour too short)
